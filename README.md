# Classification of Cats or Dogs using Basic CNN

## Overview
This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN architecture is designed to learn features from the input images and classify them into one of two categories: cat or dog.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs. Each image is labeled with the corresponding class (cat or dog). The dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation, respectively.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Geo107/Classification-using-CNN-Cats-or-Dogs-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Classification-using-CNN-Cats-or-Dogs-
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for this project consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The final layers include fully connected layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled with appropriate loss and optimizer functions for classification.


## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Augment the dataset with techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase robustness.
- Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models for better feature extraction.
